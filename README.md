# IOT-InternetofThings-FinalProject-Routing_Algorithm_Smart_Waste_Collection
This Repository contains a deeper Analysis on the Routing Algorithm for the smart waste management system!Efficient waste collection Routing Optimizing Algorithm ! 

side note : Since IOT is a new area of study for me! i thought i wouldn't fit in well. But, I learn and have fun a lot both in class and working on the project! I contribute a lot to the project!that whenever IOT projects come along in my professional life! i believe i can excel in it!

First part of this notebook include, trying to make sense of our inital algorithm

and the second part include the introduction of the improved hybrid algorithm which later is supported by its comparison with State of the Art algorithms and pros and cons of the hybrid algorithm itself!
